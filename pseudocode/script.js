// Pseudocode for TicTac Toe

/* Before a play starts playing, the game grid will be set to null (Which means no-value).
The first player input will be "X" which moves the array to 0, 
while the second player which is the computer input is "O" and it moves the array to move to increment. */


/* First I defined a variable called build which is an object. 
Inside this variable would be all the javascript functions which will perform the player and computer inputs. 
Next I created the build.ticTacToe, inside this array would be the game status.
Our build.ticTacToe will have 9 inputs which will hold each box in the game grid, which will range from "0-8" based on javascript array concept. */


// Will be two player
// Player 1(sercan) and Computer
// Game 3x3 grid boxes
// There are 8 chance to win
// horizontally : 3
// vertically : 3
// diagonally : 2

// used an array function to find winner
